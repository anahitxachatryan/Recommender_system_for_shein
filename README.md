# Product recommendation system for internet shopping (SHEIN.com)
Online shopping has become very popular recently. In order to create a smooth customer experience, e-commerce stores try to find new solutions to be on a competitive edge. One of the key success factors of an e-commerce shop is a quality recommendation system. In this paper we propose two different approaches that tackle this question and analyze SHEIN’s data. First, we build a visual similarity-based recommender system based on transfer learning techniques, and second, we propose a topic model that groups similar items together based on items’ titles and recommends users items from the same group. The developed models demonstrate mostly accurate results.
